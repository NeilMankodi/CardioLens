# CardioLens
Unraveling Heart Health through Machine Learning Analysis of NHANES Data.

Cardiovascular diseases present significant challenges to global public health. In our project, CardioLens, we delve into the intricate relationship between lifestyle habits, biological features, and the likelihood of cardiovascular problems using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we shed light on patterns of reported cardiovascular symptoms and their association with risk factors such as smoking habits and alcohol consumption. Our primary objectives are to understand how lifestyle choices influence the risk of cardiovascular issues and to identify individuals at higher risk for early intervention and personalized healthcare approaches.

The raw data for this project can be found at [NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?Cycle=2017-2020)
